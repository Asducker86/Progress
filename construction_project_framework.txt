Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

1. Stakeholder Interviews:
   - Talk to contractors, subtrades, project managers, and other relevant stakeholders to understand their needs.
   - Determine the main benchmarks, milestones, and data points they need to track.

2. Define Features:
   - Data entry capabilities (e.g., benchmarks, progress notes).
   - Dashboard for visualizing progress.
   - Notification system.
   - Access controls.

Phase 2: System Design

1. Database Design:
   - Use Google Sheets to set up a structured database.
   - Create separate sheets for benchmarks, subtrades, areas, and progress logs.

2. User Interface:
   - Design the layout of Google Forms for data entry.
   - Sketch out the appearance of the dashboard on Google Data Studio.

3. Workflow Definition:
   - Define the flow of data from Forms to Sheets.
   - Determine how Google Apps Script will process data and interface with other Google products.

Phase 3: Development

1. Google Forms:
   - Set up forms for data entry (progress updates, new benchmarks, etc.).
   - Ensure each form submits data to the appropriate sheet.

2. Google Sheets:
   - Set up structured tabs with appropriate columns.
   - Use data validation rules to ensure data consistency.

3. Google Apps Script:
   - Write scripts to process form entries.
   - Integrate with Google Cloud Natural Language API or other services for advanced NLP tasks.
   - Implement notification mechanisms (e.g., send email when a new milestone is reached).

4. Google Data Studio:
   - Connect to Google Sheets.
   - Design visual reports showing progress, outstanding tasks, and other KPIs.

5. Google Cloud Platform (for advanced features):
   - Set up a new project.
   - Integrate with Cloud Natural Language API or other tools as necessary.
   - Connect these services with Google Apps Script.

Phase 4: Testing

1. Pilot Testing:
   - Select a small group of subtrades or a single project to test the system.
   - Collect feedback on usability, data accuracy, and overall functionality.

2. Refinement:
   - Make necessary changes based on feedback.
   - Implement additional features or streamline existing processes.

Phase 5: Deployment

1. Training:
   - Organize training sessions for all users.
   - Provide documentation or guides on how to use the system.

2. Rollout:
   - Launch the system for all projects or subtrades.
   - Monitor usage and collect feedback continuously.

Phase 6: Maintenance & Iteration

1. Regular Check-ins:
   - Schedule periodic reviews with stakeholders to ensure the system meets their needs.
   - Adjust features or add new ones based on evolving requirements.

2. Backup & Security:
   - Regularly back up data.
   - Monitor access controls and permissions to ensure data security.

Considerations:

1. Cost: While many Google services are free, there might be costs associated with high usage or premium features, especially on GCP.
2. Scalability: This solution is suitable for small to medium-sized projects. If you're dealing with large-scale projects or need more advanced features, you might need to explore more robust solutions in the future.
3. Integration: If there are other tools or systems in use, consider how they might integrate with this Google-based system.

Conclusion:

This framework provides a systematic approach to building your construction project tracking system using Google products. By moving through each phase methodically and ensuring you gather feedback and iterate, you can develop a solution that is tailored to your specific needs and provides real-time insights into project progress.
